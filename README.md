# DLMS-using-CORBA
Distributed Library Management System using CORBA where clients and servants are developed in Java.

This Project is similar to DLMS-using-Java-RMI(https://github.com/y0geshchaudhary/DLMS-using-Java-RMI) in terms of funtionality but adds another flavour to technology bucket which is CORBA. CORBA is used to configure and make client-server components communicate to one another whereas just like DLMS-using-Java-RMI, Server-Server communication still happens on udp sockets.
